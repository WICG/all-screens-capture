# Capture all screens explainer

## Introduction
`getAllScreensMedia` is an API that allows clients to capture all monitors
attached to a device at once without user interaction. It is only available in
managed sessions for allow-listed web apps and it is a requirement
that the user must be informed about capturing at all times. The usage
indicator cannot be prevented by the web app.

## Motivation
Web developers have [expressed interest](https://github.com/w3c/mediacapture-screen-share/issues/204) for such an API in order to meet legal and internal
compliance requirements.

## Use cases
* Contact centers may require full documentation of provided information for
compliance and / or training purposes.
* In the financial industry a consultant may provide financial advice digitally
and a complete documentation of the information may be required by law in some
jurisdictions.
* Internet usage in prisons may require full traceability to allow convicts to
access the internet.

## API

`getAllScreensMedia` can be used similarly to `getDisplayMedia` with
a few differences:
* `getAllScreensMedia` returns a promise to a sequence of
`MediaStreams` (one `MediaStream` per monitor).
* Constraints cannot be passed in the `getAllScreensMedia` call. Constraints may be
different depending on the monitor and information determining the desired
constraints (resolution, size, â€¦) is likely only available after the monitor
was captured. Constraints can be applied on the returned `MediaStreamTrack`
with `applyConstraints`.
* `getAllScreensMedia` will only be available for web apps allowlisted by a
policy.
* Usage indicators must be shown to the user at all times.

`getAllScreensMedia` will use `ScreenCaptureMediaStreamTrack` (which is a
subclass of `MediaStreamTrack`) in the returned `MediaStream` which provides
access to monitor details analogous to the
[getScreenDetails API](https://developer.chrome.com/articles/multi-screen-window-placement/#the-getscreendetails()-method).

```idl
partial interface MediaDevices {
 Promise<sequence<MediaStream>> getAllScreensMedia();
}
```

```idl
interface ScreenCaptureMediaStreamTrack : MediaStreamTrack {
  ScreenDetailed screenDetailed();
}
```

## Example usage
```js
try {
  const mediaStreams = await navigator.mediaDevices.getAllScreensMedia();
  mediaStreams.forEach((mediaStream, index) => {
    files.push(saveToFile(mediaStream));
  })
} catch (e) {
  console.log('Unable to acquire screen captures: ' + e);
}
```
