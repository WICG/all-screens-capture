      This document defines a new API {{MediaDevices/getAllScreensMedia}}

      Introduction
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Screen Capture API [[screen-capture]] enables the capturing of a single
      <a data-cite="screen-capture#dfn-display-surface">display surface</a> in the
      form of a video track.
    </p>
    <p>

      Users currently cannot capture all
      <a data-cite="screen-capture#dfn-monitor">monitors</a> attached to a device
      at once without having to execute a two step sequence multiple times,
      i.e. an interaction with the page through a [=transient activation=] that calls
      <a data-cite="screen-capture#dom-mediadevices-getdisplaymedia">getDisplayMedia</a>
      and a subsequent interaction with the media picker.
      This is a cumbersome process and does not guarantee that all
      <a data-cite="screen-capture#dfn-monitor">monitors</a> are captured
      (which may be required by regulations).
    </p>
    <p>
      This document describes {{MediaDevices/getAllScreensMedia}}, an extension to
      the Screen Capture API [[screen-capture]].
      {{MediaDevices/getAllScreensMedia}} enables
      the capturing of several of the user's <a data-cite="screen-capture#dfn-monitor">monitors</a>,
      or parts thereof, without a [=transient activation=].
      It returns a list of media streams
      (each containing a track corresponding to the captured
      <a data-cite="screen-capture#dfn-monitor">monitor</a>).
      As no [=transient activation=] is required, the <a href="#dfn-user-agent">user agent</a>
      must ensure that appropriate protection, e.g. by allowlisting permitted
      <a data-cite="url#concept-url-origin">origin</a>.

      This specification defines conformance criteria that apply to a single product: the

      contains.
    </p>
    <p>
      Implementations that use ECMAScript [[ECMA-262]] to implement the APIs defined in this
      specification must implement them in a manner consistent with the ECMAScript Bindings
      defined in the Web IDL specification [[!WEBIDL]], as this specification uses that

        In addition to these requirements, <a href="#dfn-user-agent">user agents</a> MUST

        must not be persisted. The privacy indicators must inform about the <a data-cite="url#concept-url-origin">origin</a>

        Only the user may dismiss the privacy indicator.

      <h3>Security Considerations</h3>
      This sections discusses the major threats and mitigations.

      <h4>Threat: Cross-site scripting</h4>
      Attackers might use cross-site scripting to get access to sensitive information by using elevated permissions
      of the allowlisted apps.
      
      <h5>Mitigation</h5>
      The API is exposed in isolated contexts (i.e. in isolated web apps) only. Isolated web apps are intended to mitigate
      client-side cross-site scripting attacks by enforcing strict <a data-xref-type="http-header">Content-Security-Policy</a>
      and {{TrustedType}} and server-side cross-site scripting attacks by bundling and signing of the app.

      <h4>Threat: Violation of organization policies</h4>
      Use of the API may violate organization policies, that control which apps should have access to sensitive information.

      <h5>Mitigation</h5>
      User agents must restrict the use of the API based on allowlists defined by the organization's administrator.

      <h4>Threat: Third-party iframes initiating screen capture</h4>
      Third party iframes might initiate screen capture.

      <h5>Mitigation</h5>
      The "all-screens-capture" permissions policy will control access, preventing third-party use by default.
      To further safeguard from potential third-party attacks, isolated web apps employ a strict
      <a data-xref-type="http-header">Content-Security-Policy</a> that makes using external resources
      (i.e. the ones not originating from the Web Bundle itself) difficult and enforce cross-origin-isolation.
